# How to get started

You may have been givne an assignemnt in GitHub Classroom by your instructor ([more details](https://docs.kea.dev/posts/github-classroom/)) - or you may just simply create a copy of this repository using the "create template" feature. Either way, you will get your own detached repository to work from.

A template workflow will run automatically and copy over the issues defined in the template repo. 

Or you can initiate the copy manually by running :

```
.github/template/cpissues.sh
```

The issues are deliberately copied over in an unordely fashion - the issues numbers do not depict the natural sequence to solve them. 

Go straight to the issue titleed "README FIRST" and get further instructions from there.


# Are you GitHub Ready?

This execise makes use og VS Code and the GitHub CLI `gh`. The simplest and recommended way to do the assignment is to use a codespace on GitHub.

If you choses to run it locally on your PC in VS Code you must make sure, that command line interface `gh` (GitHub) installed. We will be using it extensively. 

Test by running

```
gh auth status
```

üí° It should tell you that you are good to go.<br/>
‚ùå If it doesn't then you need to make sure that it's [installed correctly](https://cli.github.com/manual/installation) and that you are properly [authenticated](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_auth_login).<br/>
